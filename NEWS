 NEWS/ChangeLog for multicore
------------------------------

0.1-2	(under development)
    o	added "silent" parmeter to parallel() and mclapply()
	suppressing output on stdout in child processes

    o	added internal functions closeStdout(), closeStrerr(),
	closeFD(), closeAll(), isChild(), childrenDescriptors() and
	masterDescriptor()

    o	removed spurious debugging output in mclapply()

0.1-1	2009-01-03
    o	added name parameter to parallel(), accordingly collect()
	names the results if the job name is present

    o	bug fix: collect() returned early if no jobs responded for a
	while

    o	bug fix: internal list of children could get corrupted when a
	child was removed (all preceding children were removed as well)

    o	added better debugging support. Set PKG_CFLAGS=-DMC_DEBUG to
	enable debugging output on stdout (it is purposefully not sent
	to the R console to prevent output processing issues in child
	processes)


0.1-0	2009-01-02
    o	initial release
